Project Description
This repository contains a basic calculator program written in C++. The calculator performs simple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It is designed to take user input and compute the result based on the selected operation.

Features
Supports four basic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
User-friendly interface with clear instructions.
Input validation to ensure correct operation selection and numbers.
Error handling for division by zero.
Clone or Download this repository:
Clone the repository using Git:
git clone https://github.com/Jay4758/Calculator-Project.git
Or download the ZIP file directly from the repository page.
Compile the Code:
Use a C++ compiler like g++ or the one provided by Visual Studio to compile the code:
g++ Calculator.assignment.cpp -o calculator
Run the Program:
After compilation, run the calculator:
./calculator
Follow the Prompts:
Enter two numbers and choose the operation you would like to perform.
The result will be displayed after the calculation.
Enter first number: 10
Enter second number: 5
Select operation: 
1. Add 
2. Subtract 
3. Multiply 
4. Divide
Choose option (1-4): 1
Result: 10 + 5 = 15
Future Enhancements
Implementing more advanced mathematical operations (e.g., exponentiation, square root).
Adding a graphical user interface (GUI).
Improving the error handling for edge cases.
